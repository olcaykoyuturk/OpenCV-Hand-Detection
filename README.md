## a. Hand Detection

The primary objective of this project is to implement hand detection in images and generate corresponding diagrams. Leveraging the power of OpenCV, the system accurately identifies hands within the given images.

## b. Sign out with Thumbs Up

In this segment of the project, the goal is to close the program when the hand detector recognizes a thumbs-up gesture. This innovative feature adds an interactive element to the application, allowing users to sign out with a simple hand gesture.
